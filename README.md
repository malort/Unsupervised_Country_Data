# Unsupervised_Country_Data 

Dataset provided by HELP International. 
The objective is to categorize countries according to the overall development using socio-economic and health factors.

## Requirements:

```pandas:``` Data analysis and manipulation tool.

```matplotlib:``` Visualization library.

```seaborn:``` Data visualization library based on matplotlib, it enhances the style of matplotlib plots.

```Numpy:``` Numerical analysis library.

```scikit-learn:``` Machine Learning library.

```Bokeh:``` Library for interactive data visualization.

```Plotly Express:``` High-level Python visualization library.

## First part - EDA and Unsupervised Analysis:

After a brief exploratory data analysis, several unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans, Affinity Propagation and Gaussian Mixture Model are used to group countries into three categories.

## Second part - Dimension reduction with t-SNE and Maps visualizations:

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. Data is reduced in two dimensions using t-SNE and plotted with Bokeh.

Interactive map visualizations are used to show the result of the previous analysis.
